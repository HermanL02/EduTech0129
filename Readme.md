## Description of the Project (300 words)
Online slide sharing system with the option of leaving feedback for each page. Slides are an essential part of the learning process. Most of the students will not ask any questions if something is not clear for them. Our platform allows students to share their reactions to the particular slide page. We believe that this interaction between students would make the studying process a lot better. Also, students can take notes for each individual page of a slide and come back to them whenever they want. The study room keeps all of the students' and teachers' slides organized.
